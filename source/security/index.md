title: Status Security Processes
---

# High-level overview

The Status security process is based on the best practices recommended by
[OWASP](https://www.owasp.org).

Specifically, we use a practice called [Security Champions
2.0](./security_champions.md).

The idea is to have a person called a `Security Champion` in each team and area.
This person is responsible for supporting security processes in the particular
team and area as well as supporting security initiatives throghout the
organization. 

The person doesn't have to have security background, but should be interested
in it.

Security champion works with the security community.
