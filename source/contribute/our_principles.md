# A Principled Approach to a Better Web

The goal of Status is widespread adoption of the decentralized web. It’s no small feat and we identified our guiding lights throughout the way -  a set of ideas and principles that as tools for thinking, for communication, for decentralized decision making, and that help us staying true to ourselves when - inevitably - dealing with the daily challenges and confusion.

We spent several weeks and months, to collectively compile a list of what's important to us:

**Liberty** - the sovereignty of individuals.
**Censorship Resistance** - free flow of information.
**Security** - guaranteed by new security methods and technologies.
**Privacy** - the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world.
**Transparency** - no border between our core contributors and our community.
**Openness** - the software we create is a public good.
**Decentralization** - maximizing the number of individuals who have control.
**Inclusivity** -  ease of use, but also socially - by permissionless participation, investing in education, and more.
**Continuance** -  exist and improve, without the stewardship of a single entity.
**Resourcefulness** - fight bureaucracy and inefficiencies within the organization.

Importantly, we try and actually practice the relevant principles in each individual team or part of our community. For example, our [People Team](https://people-ops.status.im/applying-our-principles-to-people-ops/) supports **Liberty** by:

*... working to enable a culture of free and asynchronous work. We support autonomy and ownership of projects, and empower contributors to make their own judgment calls. We will invest in continuous learning, and offer a variety of compensation models to ensure flexibility for contributors and encourage as many people to get involved in whichever ways suit them best. 

We have made a deliberate decision to eschew costly perks and benefits in favour of competitive base remuneration to give each contributor the economic freedom to allocate their finances in a way that best fits their circumstances.*
