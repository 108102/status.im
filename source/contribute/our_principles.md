# A Principled Approach to a Better Web

The goal of Status is widespread adoption of the decentralized web. It’s no small feat and we identified our guiding lights throughout the way -  a set of ideas and principles that as tools for thinking, for communication, for decentralized decision making, and that help us staying true to ourselves when - inevitably - dealing with the daily challenges and confusion.

We spent several weeks and months, to collectively compile a list of what's important to us:

**Liberty** - the sovereignty of individuals.
**Censorship Resistance** - free flow of information.
**Security** - guaranteed by new security methods and technologies.
**Privacy** - the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world.
**Transparency** - no border between our core contributors and our community.
**Openness** - the software we create is a public good.
**Decentralization** - maximizing the number of individuals who have control.
**Inclusivity** -  ease of use, but also socially - by permissionless participation, investing in education, and more.
**Continuance** -  exist and improve, without the stewardship of a single entity.
**Resourcefulness** - fight bureaucracy and inefficiencies within the organization.

You can read more about the principles [on our blog](https://our.status.im/our-principles/). You can also listen in to our principles discussions [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18HwQkLWqL4&list=PLbrz7IuP1hriACSQ7furdCUFkcSAJ68F4).  If you believe in what we do and in how we do it, we’d love to hear from you.
