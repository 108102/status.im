# All The Things!

1. Work with some of the most passionate & dedicated minds in the Ethereum space.  
2. We ask that you're willing to be paid in a combination of fiat and cryptocurrency.
3. We'll reward you with a competitive base salary.
4. We'll also reward you with SNT (Status Network Tokens) to give you a real stake in the success of the organisation.
5. A generous budget to choose whatever phone and laptop you prefer.
6. We regularly attend relevant conferences and team meet-ups, and twice per year the whole organisation gets together to connect.
7. We provide a small allowance for a co-working space, or to work from a caf√© occasionally.
8. We operate an open vacation policy, meaning there are no hard limits or strict rules around how much holiday you take and how you schedule it.
9. We want our contributors to be healthy and take the time they need to relax and enjoy quality disconnected time away from work.

**Note:** We don't offer traditional benefits like medical/dental insurance - we'd rather pay you well and give you the freedom to select your own benefits, on your terms.
