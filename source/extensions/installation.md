# Get Set Up

Extensions are currently installed by QR code or URL.

Once an extension is deployed via the [playground](./play.html), a unique QR code and universal link are generated for its IPFS hash.

To install the extension in Status:

1. Open the profile screen
2. Enable `Development mode`
3. Open the `Extensions` tab
4. Tap the `+` icon
5. Enter the extension's URL or scan its QR code
